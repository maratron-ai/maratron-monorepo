## Evidence-Based Training Plan Standards

Based on comprehensive analysis of 13 training scenarios and industry best practices.

### Current Performance Metrics (Post Phase 1 + 2)

- **Analysis Date**: Latest testing with Phase 1 + Phase 2 comprehensive fixes
- **Test Coverage**: 13 scenarios (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced × Various goals)

## Distance Progression Standards

### Peak Distance Requirements
```typescript
PEAK_DISTANCE_RATIOS = {
  marathon: { 
    min: 0.75,      // 19.6 miles minimum
    optimal: 0.80,  // 21.0 miles optimal  
    max: 0.85       // 22.3 miles maximum
  },
  halfMarathon: { 
    min: 1.1,       // 14.4 miles minimum
    optimal: 1.2,   // 15.7 miles optimal
    max: 1.3        // 17.0 miles maximum
  }
}
```

### Peak Timing Standards
```typescript
PEAK_TIMING = {
  '12weeks': { min: 8, optimal: 9, max: 10 },    // Week 9 optimal
  '16weeks': { min: 11, optimal: 12, max: 13 },  // Week 12 optimal  
  '20weeks': { min: 14, optimal: 15, max: 16 },  // Week 15 optimal
  '24weeks': { min: 17, optimal: 18, max: 19 }   // Week 18 optimal
}
```

**Current Status**: ✅ 81.7/100 - Good performance, some beginner plans need higher peaks

## Pace Progression Standards

### Training Pace Gaps
```typescript
PACE_GAPS = {
  startingGap: { 
    max: 45,        // Never more than 45s slower than goal
    optimal: 30     // Ideally 30s slower to start
  },
  finalGap: { 
    max: 20,        // Final training within 20s of goal
    optimal: 10     // Ideally within 10s of goal
  },
  progressionRate: { 
    min: 15,        // At least 15s improvement
    optimal: 25     // Ideally 25s+ improvement
  }
}
```

**Current Status**: ✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** (Phase 2 Complete)
- Fixed progressive blending: starts at 60% through plan instead of 80%
- Eliminated flat pace periods: smooth 61s progression (10:59 → 10:15)
- Example: VDOT 30 + 10:20 goal now shows realistic weekly improvement

## Volume Distribution Standards

### Weekly Volume Balance
```typescript
WEEKLY_VOLUME = {
  longRunPercent: { min: 25, max: 40 },    // 25-40% of weekly miles
  easyRunPercent: { min: 60, max: 80 },    // 60-80% of weekly miles  
  qualityPercent: { min: 15, max: 25 }     // 15-25% tempo/intervals
}
```

**Current Status**: ✅ 81.7/100 - **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** (Phase 1 Complete)
- Fixed smart volume distribution algorithm
- Long runs properly capped at 40% of weekly volume
- Improved easy running percentage compliance
- Remaining issues: Some plans still at 47% easy (need >60%)

## Taper Standards

### Taper Timing and Volume
```typescript
TAPER = {
  durationPercent: { min: 15, max: 30 },   // 15-30% of total plan
  volumeReduction: { min: 40, max: 60 }    // 40-60% volume reduction
}
```

**Current Status**: ✅ 91.7/100 - Excellent performance

## Training Level Adaptations

### Beginner (VDOT 20-30)
- **Performance**: 71.8/100 ⚠️ Needs improvement
- **Peak Distance**: Often too low (74% vs 75% minimum)
- **Conservative progression**: Longer build phases
- **More recovery**: Extra cutback weeks

### Intermediate (VDOT 30-45)  
- **Performance**: 86.5/100 ✅ Good
- **Best performing category**
- **Standard progression**: Balanced approach
- **Optimal peak timing**: Week 12 for 16-week plans

### Advanced (VDOT 45+)
- **Performance**: 83.8/100 ✅ Good  
- **Higher peak distances**: 85% of race distance
- **Aggressive progression**: Faster pace development
- **Shorter taper**: More training volume retained

## Critical Algorithm Improvements Needed

### 1. Volume Distribution Algorithm (Priority: ✅ COMPLETED)
**Solution Implemented**: Smart volume distribution with 80/20 compliance
```typescript
// IMPLEMENTED: Smart volume balancing
const EASY_PERCENT = 0.65;  // 65% easy running minimum
const TEMPO_PERCENT = 0.15; // 15% tempo work

// Ensure long run never exceeds 40% of weekly volume
if (adjustedLong > mileage * 0.40) {
  const scaledMileage = Math.max(mileage, adjustedLong / 0.40);
  // Rebalance with proper distribution
}

// Results: 81.7/100 volume distribution score (+6.7 improvement)
```

### 2. Final Pace Gap Reduction (Priority: HIGH)
**Problem**: 7/12 plans have final training >20s from goal
```typescript
// Current blending too conservative in final weeks
finalBlendWeight = 0.3  // Only 30% goal pace influence

// Fix: More aggressive final phase blending
if (weekNumber >= weeks * 0.85) {
  goalWeight = 0.7 + (progressInFinalPhase * 0.2); // 70% → 90%
  maxTrainingGap = 15; // Cap at 15s in final 2 weeks
}
```

### 3. Starting Pace Optimization (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Problem**: 6/12 plans start >30s from goal
```typescript
// Better VDOT-based starting pace calculation
startingGap = Math.min(
  45,  // Maximum gap
  Math.max(15, fitnessGap * 0.6)  // 60% of fitness gap
);
```

### 4. Adaptive Peak Distance (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Beginner plans often have insufficient peak distance
```typescript
// Training level specific peak distances
const adaptivePeakPct = {
  [TrainingLevel.Beginner]: Math.max(0.75, 0.70 + (weeks - 12) * 0.01),
  [TrainingLevel.Intermediate]: 0.80,
  [TrainingLevel.Advanced]: 0.85
};
```
